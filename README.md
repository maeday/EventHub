Setup
-----
Creating a local settings file:  
* Copy the file 'settings.py' from 'EventHub' and name it 
  'settings_local.py'
* Delete the last 5 lines of 'settings_local.py'
* Modify any settings in 'settings_local.py' that you want

Notes:

  will be merged to 'master' for each release
* To switch to branch 'dev', enter the command: 
  `git checkout -b dev origin/dev`
